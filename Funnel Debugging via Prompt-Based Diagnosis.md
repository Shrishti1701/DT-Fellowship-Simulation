## 🔹Step 1: Mock Funnel Dataset

| Stage           | Current Value | Issue Observed                                           |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Leads Generated | 100           | Top of funnel looks healthy.                             |
| Calls Scheduled | 20            | Only 20% leads → calls. Weak **Interest/Desire** stage.  |
| Deals Closed    | 2             | Just 10% calls → deals. Strong drop at **Action** stage. |

## 🔹Step 2: MMF (Message–Market Fit) Diagnosis
Problem Identified: Messaging isn’t creating enough desire or urgency.
Where Funnel Breaks:
*   Leads → Calls (Interest stage)
*   Calls → Deals (Action stage)

Likely Causes:
*   Outreach is feature-heavy, not benefit-driven.
*   Missing trust-builders (social proof, authority).
*   Weak call-to-action (no urgency, no clarity).

## 🔹Step 3: Fix Prompts (AIDCA + Persuasion Triggers)
🛠️ Fix Prompt 1 – Improve Lead → Call Conversion
Objective: Strengthen Interest + Desire with Authority & Social Proof.
```
Act as a growth copywriter. Rewrite this outreach so it moves prospects from curiosity to scheduling a call. 
Use AIDCA framework. Highlight authority, social proof, and one clear next step (book a call).
Tone: conversational, professional, and value-driven.
```
## ✅ Sample Output Snippet:
We’ve helped 50+ mid-sized B2B firms cut acquisition costs by 30%. I’d love to show how we can replicate this for your business. Would you be open to a quick 15-min call this week?

🛠️ Fix Prompt 2 – Improve Call → Deal Conversion
Objective: Strengthen Conviction + Action with Scarcity & Urgency.

Include a time-bound CTA.
```
## ✅ Sample Output Snippet:
From our call, I’m confident we can unlock ₹X in savings within 90 days. We’re onboarding just 3 more clients this quarter — would you like me to reserve your slot before the window closes?
