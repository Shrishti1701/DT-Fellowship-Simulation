# Strategic Summary

Honestly, this whole exercise was fun to do. Breaking it into parts in the beginning (Part 1) made it feel less heavy and more like a step-by-step puzzle. Having that structure kept me from overthinking and gave me a clear path.

## Part 1
The structure helped me start without feeling overwhelmed. It felt like small, doable steps instead of a big, heavy task.

## Part 2
I enjoyed digging into the funnel leaks. It felt a bit like detective work—spotting where people were dropping off and why. The Interest and Action stages stood out the most, and once I thought about messaging gaps, it all made sense. Adding things like urgency or authority felt practical, not just theory.

## Part 3
This was my favorite part. It shifted the focus to leaders and decision-making. The idea of a dashboard that doesn’t just show numbers but actually points out “here’s what’s working, here’s what’s broken, and here’s what to do next” was very satisfying. It made me think more about how data should guide action, not just sit there.

## Overall
The assignment connected everything for me—diagnose the funnel, fix the messaging, and design tools that make decisions easier. It was structured, useful, and honestly enjoyable to put together.
