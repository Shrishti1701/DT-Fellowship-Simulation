Honestly, this whole exercise was fun to do. Breaking it into parts in the beginning (Part 1) made it feel less heavy and more like a step-by-step puzzle. Having that structure kept me from overthinking and gave me a clear path.

In Part 2, I actually enjoyed digging into the funnel leaks. It felt a bit like detective work—spotting where people were dropping off and why. The Interest and Action stages stood out, which made sense once I thought about the messaging gaps. Adding small but powerful things like authority cues, urgency, or social proof felt like practical fixes rather than theory.

Part 3 was my favorite because it shifted the focus to leaders and decision-making. Designing a dashboard that doesn’t just show numbers but actually tells you “here’s what’s working, here’s what’s broken, and here’s what to do next” felt very satisfying. It made me think about how data can be presented in a way that sparks action, not confusion.

Overall, this assignment connected the dots for me—diagnose the funnel, fix the messaging, and then design tools that make decisions easier. It was structured, useful, and honestly quite enjoyable to put together.
