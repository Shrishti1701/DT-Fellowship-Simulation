## ‚úâÔ∏è Prompt 1 ‚Äì Persona: CTO of a D2C Brand
AI Prompt:
```
You are an expert B2B copywriter. Write a personalized outbound email for a CTO of a D2C brand. Structure the email using the AIDCA model:

[Attention] Highlight a pressing tech/scalability challenge common to D2C (e.g., rising CAC, slow tech stack).  
[Interest] Show how other D2C brands solved this using data automation + CRM nurturing.  
[Desire] Position Growth OS as a proven tool that reduces CAC and improves retention.  
[Conviction] Back with authority: mention case studies / industry benchmarks.  
[Action] End with a clear CTA: ‚ÄúSchedule a 20-min strategy call this week.‚Äù

Persuasion Principles:  
- Authority (case studies, benchmarks)  
- Scarcity (limited free strategy slots this quarter)  

Negative Prompt:  
- Avoid generic compliments like ‚ÄúYour company is doing great.‚Äù  
- Avoid irrelevant industries or stats outside D2C.  
```

Subject line: Cutting CAC & scaling retention without overhauling your stack

Hi [First Name],

[Attention]
Most D2C CTOs I speak with are fighting the same uphill battle: rising CAC + sluggish tech stacks that make scaling retention programs harder than acquiring the next customer.

[Interest]
The D2C brands that broke out of this cycle didn‚Äôt pour more budget into ads ‚Äî they automated their data flows and used CRM-driven nurturing to turn one-time shoppers into repeat buyers.

[Desire]
That‚Äôs exactly what Growth OS enables: it plugs into your existing systems, reduces CAC by streamlining acquisition channels, and boosts retention with automated, personalized lifecycle journeys.

[Conviction]
For instance, a leading D2C wellness brand cut CAC by 22% in 90 days and increased repeat purchase rate by 35% after implementing Growth OS. Similar benchmarks hold across fashion, beauty, and consumer electronics brands we work with.

[Action]
I‚Äôm offering a handful of free 20-minute strategy calls this quarter to share how top D2C players are compounding retention while cutting acquisition costs.
Would you be open to scheduling one this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Role]

## ‚úâÔ∏è Prompt 2 ‚Äì Persona: COO of a Pharma SME
AI Prompt:
```
You are an expert B2B copywriter. Write a personalized outbound email for a COO of a pharma SME. Structure the email using the AIDCA model:

[Attention] Begin with compliance + efficiency challenges pharma SMEs face (manual processes, regulatory delays).  
[Interest] Show how automation + CRM reduced approval cycles and improved reporting in similar pharma SMEs.  
[Desire] Present Growth OS as a tool ensuring compliance + operational efficiency.  
[Conviction] Add social proof: reference partnerships with pharma clients.  
[Action] CTA: ‚ÄúBook a compliance-automation demo next week.‚Äù

Persuasion Principles:  
- Reciprocity (offer free compliance checklist)  
- Social Proof (mention pharma SMEs already onboard)  

Negative Prompt:  
- Avoid jargon-heavy regulatory terms that confuse a non-technical COO.  
- Avoid over-promising (‚Äú100% compliance guaranteed‚Äù).  
```
## Sample email draft for a COO of a pharma SME, structured with the AIDCA model and persuasion principles baked in (Output):
Subject line: Cutting compliance delays without adding headcount

Hi [First Name],

[Attention]
Most pharma SMEs I speak with are caught between manual processes and ever-tightening regulations. The result? Slower approval cycles, rising compliance risks, and teams stretched thin managing audits and reporting.

[Interest]
Similar pharma SMEs solved this by automating their compliance workflows and integrating CRM-driven reporting. The shift reduced approval cycle times by weeks and gave leadership real-time visibility into compliance status ‚Äî without adding more paperwork or staff.

[Desire]
That‚Äôs exactly what Growth OS is built for: helping pharma operations stay compliant while running lean. It streamlines document tracking, flags gaps early, and keeps reporting audit-ready, so your team can focus on scaling operations instead of firefighting compliance issues.

[Conviction]
We‚Äôre already supporting multiple pharma SMEs that have cut compliance delays by over 30% and improved cross-team efficiency. Their COOs tell us it feels like adding a compliance officer ‚Äî without actually hiring one.

[Action]
I‚Äôd like to offer you two things:

A free Compliance Checklist (based on learnings from our pharma clients).

A chance to book a 30-min compliance-automation demo next week ‚Äî where I can walk you through exactly how Growth OS fits into your existing setup.

Would you like me to share the checklist and pencil in a demo slot?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Role]
