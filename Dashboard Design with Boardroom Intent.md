## 🎯 Objective
Design a B2B outreach dashboard that helps leadership make boardroom decisions, not just track metrics. The dashboard should clearly show:
*   Are we hitting the right personas?
*   Are our messages resonating at each funnel stage?
*   Where should leadership intervene – nurturing or targeting?

## 🔹Dashboard Structure
Sections to include:
1.  Funnel Conversion Metrics
    *   Lead → MQL → SQL → Client
    *   Stage-wise conversion %
    *   Drop-off reasons (visual: color-coded bar/heatmap)

2.  Campaign-wise AIDCA Diagnosis
    *   Attention → Interest → Desire → Conviction → Action
    *   Highlight where messaging fails per campaign
    *   Include Cialdini principles applied
    *   Quick glance indicators (✔️ for working, ⚠️ for weak)

3.  Strategic Recommendations
    *   Leadership focus areas: Nurturing vs Targeting
    *   Suggested actions for weak stages
    *   Notes for follow-up campaigns
